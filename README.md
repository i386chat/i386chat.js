# Run Instructions
Example bot is bundled. Check this for more information on how to use the library.

Currently, you should just edit the index.js in ``src/`` to run a bot until we get a chance to push this library to npm.

# Build Instructions
API should be called as a library, e.g. ``const Client = require('i386js');``
